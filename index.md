### Phoenix

[Phoenix](https://github.com/team-phoenix/Phoenix) is a multi-system emulator that plays a plethora of consoles, from Atari 2600, to the PlayStation One.

This is a project that I have been actively working on since late 2013. When I started working on this project I was a 2nd year student at Wayne State University hoping to learn more about video and audio rendering, along with gaining a deeper understanding on programming in general. In order to work on this project, I had to teach myself C++, SQL, QML, and the Qt C++ libraries.
